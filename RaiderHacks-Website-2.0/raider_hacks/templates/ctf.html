	<h1>Secuirty CTF</h1>
	<p>
	CTFs are events that are usually hosted at information security conferences, hackathons and on verious internet platforms (like hack the box). These events consist of a series of challenges that vary in their degree of difficulty, and that require participants to exercise different skillsets to solve. Once an individual challenge is solved, a “flag” is given to the player and they submit this flag to the CTF server to earn points. Players can be lone wolves who attempt the various challenges by themselves, or they can work with others to attempt to score the highest number of points as a team.
