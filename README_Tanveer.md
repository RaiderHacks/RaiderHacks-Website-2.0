To submit push requets, your public key

must be added to the RaiderHacks git

server.

Good news. The RaiderHacks SSH Git Server

actually accepted my ed25519-sk key, even

though it requires touch-based FIDO U2F.

This makes the Git Server I set up more

secure and trustworthy than even GitHub's

or even GitLab's. Neither of them support

U2F-based public key authentication at this

time, let alone U2F-based Ed25519 public

key authentication.


It is now my responsibility to assist the

RaiderHacks use this new Git server.

Everyone is required to digitally sign

their commits as reliable assurance that

they are the real person performing the 

git commit and not someone unwelcome.

Everyone contributing the RaiderHacks

website must posses their own U2F key

to digitally sign their git commits

with the help of GPG.

It is my responsibility, Tanveer, to

ensure that everyone understands how

that works.

Dear All of You,

I have set aside an actual GPG key that I will

use to sign all my git commits. It is meant

to be exclusively used for all RaiderHacks's

development. I will send and teach all of

you how to use GPG.

The reason we care about this is so we have

reliable assurance git commits are coming from

the actual person that claims to be someone.

My GPG key fingerprint is: 175D5E863DF1BDEFBF34CE5AEDCB0582B9A05B98.

The GPG secret key must be passwordless for this

to work.

Testing with Joseph's trusted GPG key.
